# Conspiracy Theories in Turkey: a Social Network Analysis of Post-COVID 19.
The main purpose of this research is to visualize the impact of the conspiracy theory spreaders in Turkey’s Twitter Network for the last 30 days while finding common grounds between their arguments and conspiracy theories in general. Following this aim, we believe that similar to other conspiracy theory networks our network will be isolated. Furthermore, we also believe that, Turkish conspiracy theorists are using the same arguments and similar thinking patterns which can be found across the globe.

## Research Design
For testing if the common spreaders' arguments share the common ground with conspiracy theories across the globe, we have decided to filter some tweets from most common conspiracy theory spreaders. According to Teyit.org, which is a well-known fact checking organization in Turkey, Twitter users "@maranki”,”@aDilipak”,”@5gvirusnewss”,”@ErkanTrukten" are tweeting conspiracy theories, misinformation and malinformation frequently. Thus we have decided to reach their timeline and conduct a textmining on their tweets. Additionally we have decided to textmine all of the fact checked claims and the words used in them from dogrulukpayi.com, which is another well-known fact checking organization linked to IFCN(International Fact Checking Network). After filtering with stopwords, we have decided to combine the users' tweets with words in articles. After that, we  have aimed to tweets that includes these words tweeted in last 30 days.
